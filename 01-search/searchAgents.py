"""
This file contains all of the agents that can be selected to
control Pacman.  To select an agent, use the '-p' option
when running pacman.py.  Arguments can be passed to your agent
using '-a'.  For example, to load a SearchAgent that uses
depth first search (dfs), run the following command:

> python pacman.py -p SearchAgent -a fn=depthFirstSearch

Commands to invoke other search strategies can be found in the
project description.

Please only change the parts of the file you are asked to.
Look for the lines that say

"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

The parts you fill in start about 3/4 of the way down.  Follow the
project description for details.

Good luck and happy searching!
